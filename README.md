Learning GitHub 

Hi!

My name is Rinu, and I have just started the CS50 course Computer Science.
So far I have learned about variables (let & const), operators, functions(), arrays[], conditions, loops.. Did I forget something?
Who knows what the future holds and which 'branch' of my time-line I will actualy get to see. Yeah, pun intended.

See ya!
